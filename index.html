         <p>The government of Andhra Pradesh has introduced the revolutionary and
           state of art WhatsApp governance services today and this is a step towards eliminating
            physical presence at government offices and providing services virtually.

          Now that the WhatsApp governance is fully in effect, here’s a step by step guide to the
           services that are offered here.
          
          This portal essentially offers direct access to as many as 161 services including temple 
          endowments, grievance redressal, APSRTC, electricity biller, CM Relief Fund, water
           connections and property management, revenue services, NTR health services,
            AP Police Services and others.</p>

        <aside><p>WhatsApp Governance was the bridge between the government and the people. 
          The government would take the responsibility of providing certificates in real time.
           When certificates are provided, there will be a special QR code on them. 
           If one scans that QR code, the link would go to the AP government website.
           The Chief Minister highlighted that the days of citizens going from pillar to 
           post in government offices to secure certificates will come to an end with this new 
           initiative.

           However, he also cautioned against potential misuse of data by cyber criminals.
            He underscored the need to strengthen forensic and cyber security units to ensure
             that citizens’ personal information does not fall into the wrong hands.</p>

            <div class="About">
            <p>In a pioneering initiative in India, Andhra Pradesh has launched ‘Mana Mitra,’
               a WhatsApp-based governance service. Unveiled by Information and Technology
                Minister Nara Lokesh, the service aims to enhance citizen engagement by offering
                 seamless access to government services. The state has designated 95523 00009 as
                  the official WhatsApp contact for delivering essential services,
                   sharing information, and gathering public feedback.

              With WhatsApp Governance, citizens will no longer need to visit government offices
               to obtain certificates and services. This marks a significant milestone in digital
                governance and enhances accessibility for all, said Nara Lokesh during the launch
                 event.</p>

    <p>In the first phase, the ‘Mana Mitra’ service will offer 161 services across various 
      departments, including Endowments, Energy, APSRTC, Revenue, and Municipal Services. 
      The government plans to expand the service further, integrating more departments and
       functionalities to make governance more accessible and efficient.

      With this tech-driven transformation, Andhra Pradesh is setting a precedent for digital
       public service delivery, reinforcing its commitment to innovation and citizen-centric 
       governance.
